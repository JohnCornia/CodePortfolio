# John's Code Portfolio

Welcome! Here are some of my past projects.

### HTML, CSS & JavaScript projects

##### [Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Mount Escapes and Attacks](https://johncornia.github.io/WDD_330/blockTwoChallenge/index.html)
This is a dynamic web application making use of the fetch() API to collect data from a JSON object in a text file. This app can be used for BJJ practitioners at any belt level to see tutorials on how to escape and attack from the bottom position of any mounted opponent.

##### [Conjugate Method Application](https://johncornia.github.io/Conjugate_Method/)
This is a static web application that generates workouts for powerlifters according to the Conjugate Method, otherwise known as the Westside Method by Louie Simmons.

##### [Student Musician Registration](https://cs213-portfolio.herokuapp.com/assign13.html)
